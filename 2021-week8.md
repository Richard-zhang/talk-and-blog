# [Data oriented design](https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/data-oriented-vs-object-oriented-design-50ef35a99056)

1. Establish what objects are.
2. Determine what types of data belong to an object.
3. Describe the functionality an object has.

* Object oriented design encapsulate data and could be bad for locality

* Data-oriented design - the gist
* Promotes deep domain knowledge
  * no virtual call 

* Animation system
* Tick operation
  * Input: 1. Animation Definition 2. Time
  * Output: 1. changed properties 2. New property value 3. Who owns the new values
* Design for many animations

* AnimationStateCommon

* Array of structures v.s. Structure of Arrays

* Conclusion: I don't know what the talk is about

# [Better Living Through Base Functors]
* newType Term f = In { ut :: f (Term f) }
* base functor
  * Expr => traditional recursive definition
  * ExprF 
    * replace recursive definition with type variable a
    * Fix
    * Issue
      * NatF has kind * -> *
      * ListF has kind * -> * -> *
```haskell
type Algebra   f a = f a -> a
type Coalgebra f a = a   -> f a
```
* ```type family Base t :: * -> *```
```haskell
class (Functor (Base t)) => Recursive t where
    project :: t -> Base t t
    cata    :: Algebra (Base t) a -> t -> a
    para    :: ...
```
* similar to Fold typeclass
* use simple data type directly
* motivation: t can be [a] instead of Fix (ListF a)
  * cata has more natural definition

* Reversing the Arrows, Again
  * Recursive t ==> Corecursive t

* GHC Code generation
  * cata f = c where c = f . fmap c . project
  * name (cata f) as c as a simple function is easier for GHC to generate efficient code

# [Recursion Schemes, Part VI: Comonads, Composition and Generality](https://blog.sumtypeofway.com/posts/recursion-schemes-part-6.html)

```haskell
class Functor f => Comonad w where
    extract :: w a -> a
    duplicate :: w a -> w (w a)
```

* the essence of haskell is composition
```data Cofree f a = a :< f (Cofree f a)```
* Cofree Comonad of a functor f
* Cofree Comonad are quite useful for annotating syntax trees, or talking about streams

* cata  ~ Comonad: Identity
* para  ~ Comonad: (a, _)
* histo ~ Comonad: Cofree f

* Monad transformer
  * each monad transformer defines a capability of the programer
  * the inner most monad is usually Identity (pure computation) or IO (impure computation)
* Comonad transformer
```haskell
data EnvT env w a = EnvT env (w a)
    deriving Functor

class Comonad w => ComonadEnv e w | w -> e where
    ask :: w a -> a

instance Comonad w => Comonad (EnvT env w) where
    extract (EnvT env wa) = extract wa
    duplicate (EnvT env wa) = EnvT env $ duplicate wa

class Comonad w => ComonadCofree f w | w -> f where
    unwrap :: w a -> f (w a)
```
* Take away: ComonadCofree interface provides an abstraction over the Cofree Comonad: the unwrap function

# [Recursion scheme, Part IV: Time is of the Essence]
* apomorphisms
  * histomorphism
  * futumorphism


Recap

* para is associated with RAlgebra (Useful to express recursion like factorial)
```
type RAlgebra f a = f (Term f, a) -> a
para f = out >>> fmap (id &&& para f) >>> f
```

* Fibonacci
```haskell
type CVAlgebra f a = f (Cofree f a) -> a
histo-wrong :: CVAlgebra f a -> Term f -> a
histo-wrong f = out >>> fmap worker >>> f
    where worker t = (histo-wrong f t) :< (fmap worker (out t))
```
* it's wrong because each iteration of worker recomputes, rather than reuses

* fix above by making worker operate on Cofree
```haskell
extractA :: Cofree f a -> a
extractA (a :< _) = a

histo :: CVAlgebra f a -> Term f -> a
histo h = worker >>> extractA
    where worker = out >>> fmap worker >>> (h &&& id) >>> (:<)
```
* fibonacci
```haskell
-- natural number is Maybe: data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
fibonacci = histo f
    where f :: Maybe (Cofree Maybe Int) -> Int
          f Nothing = 1
          f (Just (_ :< Nothing)) = 1
          f (Just (a :< (Just (c :< _)))) = a + c 
```

* coin change problem

* co of histo
```haskell
futu :: Functor f => CVCoalgebra f a -> a -> Term f
futu f = 
```
